lex-build builds lexers in different languages. It is separated in a front end
and multiple back ends. The front end is lex-first.awk. The back ends are per
supported language, e.g. lex-awk.awk, lex-c.awk, etc. lb_lib.awk is the library
shared by the front and all back ends. lb_lib.awk in turn uses libraries from
awklib and is hence generated with make by concatenating all needed sources
together.

make options:
make all       - lib + lex*
make allt      - all + test
make test      - run tests
make testv     - like test but verbose
make lib       - generates the lex-build library
make lex-first - generate lex-first.awk
make lex-c     - generates the C translator
make lex-awk   - generates the awk translator
make help      - this screen

Example C run:
$ awk -f lex-first.awk input.lb | awk -f lex-c.awk

Example awk run:
$ awk -f lex-first.awk input.lb | awk -f lex-awk.awk
