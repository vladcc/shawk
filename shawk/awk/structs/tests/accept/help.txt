structs.awk 1.0 - type compiler

Use: structs.awk <structs-file>

Compiles type descriptions into a type system in awk. 'Compiles in awk'
means it generates awk source code for setters/getters for each type's
members, along with facilities to create an entity of a certain type, check
its type, and a table to remember what values all type variables have. For
an example use the following as an input file:

start
type btree
has left
has right
end

Options:
-vFsm=1     - print the fsm 'grammar'
-vVersion=1 - version information
-vHelp=1    - this screen
