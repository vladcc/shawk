	rdpg.awk v1.1 -> v1.11
	change - forms '{goal,fail} return {true,false,call}' are now reduced only
	to 'return {true,false,call}', i.e. the goal/fail is removed, so the return
	statements can transparently go through the optimization process

	bug fix - drop_redundant_else() screwed up when a function had no else
	clause in Olvl=2, which was throwing Olvl=3 in an infinite recursion

	change - -TOK- syntax is removed; can be achieved with an optional rule
