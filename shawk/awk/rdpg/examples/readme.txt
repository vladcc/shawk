Here you can see what kind of code rdpg generates and how it would come together
in different languages. The code examples are generally taken from
../src/backends/tests/to-*-test-src and maybe changed a bit so they are easier
to build and run. There's no guarantee they'll be kept in sync with the actual
test source code.
