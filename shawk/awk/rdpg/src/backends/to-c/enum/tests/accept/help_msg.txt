This enum parser parses C style curly braces enums. It understands single line
comments with '//', multi line comment with '/* ... */', expects enum constant
names consist of only [A-Z]_[0-9], are followed by a comma and are not followed
by an assignment. If there are multiple enum {} declarations in the file, it
takes the first one.
